## Usage
After installing necessary requirements, using the program is quite self-explanatory.

1. Run `python audiojack_gui.py` or `python audiojack_gui_v2.py` (`v2` is preferred and more actively developed).
2. Paste a YouTube or SoundCloud URL in the search box and click on "Go!"
3. After waiting about 10 seconds, a grid of song titles, artists, and albums will appear.
4. Click on the metadata you wish to add to your downloaded MP3 file, or if none of them are correct, fill out the "Custom tags" form.
5. Voil√†! The MP3 file will be in the same directory you ran the program from.

## Requirements
1. Python 2.7
2. [AudioJack](https://github.com/Blue9/AudioJack)
2. [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (for MP3 conversion).  
3. In addition, you will need to install the following modules for AudioJack to work:
 - [mutagen](https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen)
 - [musicbrainzngs v0.6.dev0](https://github.com/alastair/python-musicbrainzngs)
 - [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)

## FAQ
Why are there two versions?
- I made `audiojack_gui.py` using `Tkinter` widgets. After realizing how ugly the native `Tkinter` widgets were, I decided to create a new version using `ttk` widgets, which use the native system UI. As of now, I plan to continue development on `audiojack_gui_v2.py`.
